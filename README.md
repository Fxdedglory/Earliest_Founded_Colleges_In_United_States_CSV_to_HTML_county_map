# Earliest_Founded_Colleges_In_United_States_CSV_to_HTML_county_map


Compilation of a few of the earliest founded universities in the united states and their dot location on a map. 

The map used is a county map (nearish November 2024).

This is a simple example of how you can take a csv file with location coordinates(longitude and latitude) and plot them on an image, in this case a county map, in HTML.

Features like these can be embedded within a webpage, real-time dashboard, or batch report.
